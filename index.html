      <p>I am the founder of <em>Alpha Customs</em>. I started out as a server at<em> Rams Horn</em> at the age of 16, I worked there for a year. After the adventures being a server I went and worked at a bakery for about 6 months
      Through working at a restaurant and bakery,you get a feel for the world early on. There adventures continue at <em>Beydoun BP</em>, Worked there for 3 years. In the mix I opened my first business It was called <em>Alpha Customs</em>.
    I want to take a minute to talk about this one, this was a real nice time. I learned how to sell and communicate to clients and people in general, I went In the business with $100, a hope, and a dream. I ran It with a friend
  at the time, Lets just say I'm happy that we dont assciate anymore. Have some time In the road contrstuction scene, I did not like this job too much... Now I work at <em>Quicken</em> as a MLO. </p>
